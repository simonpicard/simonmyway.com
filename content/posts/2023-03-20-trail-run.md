# So you want to Trail Run?

Over the last years, I picked up some experience in trail running. Or fastpacking. Or ultra-light trekking. Whatever you want to call it, I describe it as going on hike at a faster-than-normal pace. Indeed:

- In 2020, [I hiked alone the GR20 in 6 days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsvvGoqfsj4), Corsica, France
- In 2021, [I completed the Alta Via 2 in 6 days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z__MWA05t6Y), Dolomites, Italy
- In 2022, [I solo-toured the GR54 in 5 days](/blog/ultralight-trekking-the-gr54-185km-in-5-days), Massif des Ã©crins, France

Thus, in this post, I would like to share about my experience in this domain.

## Do what you enjoy

It's important to remember that trail running, or any multi-day hike, is meant to be enjoyable. Whether you're a working professional or a student, this kind of trip is likely a choice, a tradeoff with other types of vacations such as a beach trip with friends or city tours. It's a holiday. _And if it is not, i.e. you're a professional trail runner, then it's unlikely that I have anything to teach you!_ Therefore, keep in mind that it is your trip and you should have it your way.

When I first attempted "trail running" in 2018, I planned to complete the GR20 reversed in seven days. I had a few weeks off in early September before starting my new job at McKinsey & Company, and I wanted to make the most of my time. I decided to spend two weeks in Corsica, enjoying the mountains and relaxing on the beach before working hard in top tier consulting.

I noticed that the GR20 stages were typically planned for 3 to 6 hours with a total of 15 stages and a one stage per day cadence. But there's 24 hours in a day and it's for sure possible to find enough time to hike two stages in a day... Right? Unfortunately, I got injured on the third day, and I had to cut my trip short and head to the beach earlier than planned - ahah.

There is no right or wrong way to hike. If you prefer to spend the afternoon at the shelter to enjoy the view and connect with fellow trekkers, then go for it. If you want to complete a trek as fast as possible for the challenge, then that's okay too. As long as you take necessary precautions and avoid taking inconsiderate risks, you should do it your way and enjoy the experience.

## Planning ahead

### Early options

When planning a trek, the first decision to make is which trek to go on. My advice is to choose a trek based on what appeals to you, whether it's a region you want to explore or a particular type of trail, such as coastal or high-mountain terrain. You can find plenty of inspiration online or in dedicated books.

Equally important is deciding how you intend to trek. There are two primary considerations:

- Will you carry a tent, or will you sleep in shelters?
- Will you bring your own food and stove, or will you eat in shelters and resupply daily?

These decisions will affect the size and weight of your backpack, as well as your budget. For my treks, I have mostly slept and eaten in shelters, with the exception of [a 3-day autonomous epxerience in Belgium](https://youtu.be/pol2x3JK_fc).

### Getting informations

Once you've made the initial decisions about your route and how you'll be trekking, it's time to dive into the data. This is where you can really start to get a sense of what you're getting into and what to expect along the way.

Here you want to get an exhaustive knowledge about the stages of the hike, including their length and difficulty, where you can rest, sleep, and refuel. Those kind of
information are typically found online or within dedicated books such as "topoguide".

When I planned my GR54 trek, I made sure to compile detailed information for each segment:

- Time estimate
- Distance
- Elevation gain
- Elevation drop
- Availability of shop and shelters
- What official stage is the segment part of

![GR54 stages plan](/img/posts/trail-running-how-to/gr54_infos.png)

One key resource that I highly recommend is finding a GPS trace of the trail. This can be a lifesaver when you're out there on the trail, making sure you stay on course and don't get lost. I typically look for _GPX_ files, which can be loaded onto a smartphone app like _Gaia GPS_ for easy reference.

It is also the moment to consider alternative paths on the trek. Often, there are unofficial trails that lead to breathtaking and less crowded views. For instance, passing by the Incudine on the GR20 or Eychauda's Lake on the GR54 provide great experiences.

Another important aspect to consider is the gear and clothing you will need, depending on the region and the season during which you will hike. This will ensure that you are well-prepared for any weather conditions you might face.

Once you have all the necessary information, you're ready to pack your bags and hit the trail. Deciding how flexible you will be during your trek is also crucial. You can follow a set schedule, decide which stage you will complete each day, or keep some freedom. If you plan to be autonomous, you can live day by day, eating and sleeping whenever and wherever you want. However, if you plan to rely on shelters, you may want to book in advance to secure your spot.

Personally, I enjoy the flexibility of a serendipitous trek. I start my day early and keep moving until I feel like stopping. Knowing how long it takes to reach the next possible stop using the segment plan is super helpful. But remember, some shelters might be at full capacity, so be sure to understand how likely it is to happen by getting some feedback online or directly calling them.

With all this knowledge in hand, you're ready for your adventure. Get ready to embrace the unexpected, discover new paths, and make unforgettable memories.

## My tips for actually hiking

**Merino all the way**. When it comes to hiking clothes, merino fabric has been a game changer. That magic material comes with several benefits, the most important for me is that it does not stink over time and you can thus wear the same clothes multiple day without issue. I use a single T-shirt on my treks. Merino is also a great thermo regulator, keeping you warm when needed and allowing your body to breathe, avoiding wetting your clothes. Merino wise, I typically bring with me socks, legging, short sleeve T shirt, long sleeve T shirt, sleeves and briefs.

**Volume over speed**. To hike longer distances, it's easier to hike more than faster. I typically trek 10 to 13 hours a day and avoid hiking in the dark. I start my day just before sunrise, usually around 4-5 AM, and stop when I feel like it or at sunset. I rarely run and I am a relatively tall and heavy hiker, thus slow uphill. I do typically run downhill though. This way of trekking usually makes me 2 to 3 times faster than standard trek planning.

**Store water on the front**. To lighten my backpack, I use a hydration vest backpack. These types of backpacks have pockets on the straps to store water bottles, distributing the weight and allowing easy access to water. Check out _Ultimate Direction_ for some great options.

**It's about the people**. While the views are incredible and the sense of achievement is fulfilling, the people you meet on the trail are what make the experience truly unforgettable. Even though I usually hike alone, the encounters I have had in the mountains have been unique and meaningful. Whether it's chatting with the shelter guardians or fellow hikers, the conversations are always great and caring. I recommend sleeping near official shelters and sharing your dinner with others. If you sleep in a shelter dormitory, make sure to bring earplugs!

Then, here are some more practical tips:

- Arrange your different clothes in compression packs for efficient backpack organization
- Use toe socks to prevent rubbing between your toes and avoid blisters
- Set up elastic laces for effort-less shoe slip on and off. They also provide a strong yet flexible hold
- Hook some carabiners to your backpack, it will be handy in different ways, such as letting your clothes dry while hiking
- Opt for foldable hiking poles for quick and easy dismounting
- Have a running belt to store a few stuff around your waist, with straps on the back to hold poles
- If you are into music, bring wired earbuds that don't require recharging, use guiche clips to lock the cable onto your backpack straps
- Carry mixed nuts with you for snacks. Get sweet and salted mix
- Red tiger's balm will help your muscle recovery

## Are you sufficiently trained?

The safest way to know is to try. Load up your backpack and lace up your hiking shoes, then hit the trail near you. Start with shorter hikes to gauge your endurance and determine whether you enjoy the experience. If you want to estimate how much distance you can cover daily, try measuring how much elevation you can handle within an hour. If you live in a flat area, head to the gym and try out the stair climber. Then combine your estimated distance and elevation paces to determine how fast you can hike a stage.

Hiking requires more than just physical endurance; it also demands a functional body and resilience. If you're not used to hiking regularly, you may develop injury if you go too hard, such as a join inflamation. However, some discomfort is OK, e.g. a blister is not a trek-stopper, if you do not mind too much. So it's important to differentiate between discomfort and pain, to ensure that you're not pushing yourself too far and putting yourself at risk of injury.

For reference, here's a look at my own 6-months volume of walking and running over the years.

![6-months volume of walking and running chart](/img/posts/trail-running-how-to/running_mileage.png)

I began running somewhat regularly in 2013 and ran my first ever 10km in 1 hours and 7 minutes back then. Unfortunately, I could not find my tracking data for that period. The above chart is based on _Strava_ data, which I started using in 2019.

Summer 2018 was my first attempt at the GR20. During that one, developped a tendinitis and gave up. Two years later, for my second and successful attempt, I had reached 450 km volume over 6 months. Keep in mind that these figures aren't comprehensive, but they should give you an idea of my level of training.

Remember, hiking can be a challenging and rewarding experience. But it's important to ensure that you're physically and mentally prepared for the rigors of the trail. So take your time, start small, and build up your endurance gradually.
